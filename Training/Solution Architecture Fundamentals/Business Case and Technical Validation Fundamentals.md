## 🎯 The Role of Solution Architects in Business Case & Technical Validation

### **What Happens in This Stage?**

- **Opportunity Assessment:**
    
    - **Business Analysts** assess the processes for business value, complexity, and feasibility.
        
    - **Solution Architects** validate these processes from a technical perspective.
        

### **Key Responsibilities of the Solution Architect:**

- **Technical Validation:**
    
    - Review selected use cases to ensure they can be automated effectively.
        
- **Effort Estimation:**
    
    - Estimate development effort and resources required.
        
- **Application Access Plan:**
    
    - Create a detailed plan to manage and track access requirements.
        

> **Note:**  
> The Solution Architect plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between business needs and technical implementation, ensuring the selected processes are both valuable and achievable.

## 🗂️ The Application Access Plan

### **Why It’s Critical:**

- **Mitigates Risk:**
    
    - Prevents development delays by ensuring all necessary application accesses are granted early.
        
- **Enhances Efficiency:**
    
    - Helps streamline the development lifecycle and minimizes issues during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and deployment.
        
- **Standardization:**
    
    - Uses a standard format to manage access requests across multiple users and environments.
        

### **Key Considerations When Creating the Tracker:**

- **Automation Efficiency:**
    
    - As the number of automated processes grows, the tracker becomes essential to manage complex access requirements.
        
- **Solution Design:**
    
    - Ensure every user or machine involved has the appropriate access.
        
- **Multiple Environments:**
    
    - Track access for:
        
    - **Development Environment:** Where automation is built.
        
    - **Testing Environment:** A mirror of production for UAT.
        
    - **Production Environment:** Where automation runs live.
        

> **Tip:**  
> The Application Access Tracker is a living document. While the Solution Architect initiates it, Business Analysts continuously update it as new application needs are identified.
