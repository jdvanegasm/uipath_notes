## 📌 Overview

In this stage, we validate the automation solution against agreed requirements and customer expectations. The UAT phase confirms that the solution works as intended, while Deployment and Hypercare ensure a smooth transition to production and provide ongoing support post-deployment.

As a Solution Architect, your responsibilities include:

- **Validating Functionality:** Ensure that the solution meets both technical and business requirements.
    
- **Documentation:** Document any changes and maintain the alignment between the PDD, SDD, and the automation runbook.
    
- **Performance Monitoring:** Keep an eye on performance metrics and be ready to offer support.
    
- **Facilitating UAT:** Guide the team in setting up, executing, and tracking test cases and scenarios.
    
- **Supporting Deployment:** Develop a robust deployment plan and participate actively during Hypercare to swiftly address any issues.
