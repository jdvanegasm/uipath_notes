## 🔑 License Estimation

### **Objective:**

- **Learn:** List the factors that influence license estimation for a seamless automation implementation.
    

### **1. Minimum License Requirements (Before Development)**

- **Studio Licenses:**
    
    - Estimate based on the number of developers needed.
        
- **Development Testing Licenses:**
    
    - **Requirement:** At least one unattended robot license per process for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Unit Testing.
        
- **Production Licenses:**
    
    - **Requirement:** At least one license per process to ensure readiness for production.
        
- **Special Licenses:**
    
    - Allocate licenses for additional components such as:
        
        - **Insights**
            
        - **AI Center**
            
        - **Document Understanding (DU)**
            
        - **Test Manager**
            
        - **Attended Robots**
            
        - **Integration Service**

### **2. License Estimation During Process Development**

- **Process Needs:**
    
    - Evaluate factors like:
        
        - **User Interactions**
            
        - **Intelligent Language Processing**

        - **High Runtime/Volume:** Ensure enough robots are allocated.
            
        - **Scalability:** Adjust the number of robots as process complexity evolves.
            

> **Note:**  
> Regularly review license utilization during development and adjust estimates to match evolving process requirements.

### **Best Practices for License Estimation**

- **Process Complexity Assessment:**
    
    - Evaluate the complexity of each process.
        
    - Assess the workload to determine the required number of attended and unattended robots.
        
    - Factor in infrastructure needs (server capacity, network resources).
        
- **Transaction Analysis:**
    
    - Consider transaction frequency and volume.
        
    - Understand resource utilization patterns during peak and off-peak times.
        
- **Load Testing for Performance:**
    
    - Conduct load tests to simulate various scenarios.
        
    - Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize performance accordingly.
        
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    
    - Evaluate the level of parallel processing needed.
        
    - Ensure efficient resource allocation for scalable automation.
        
- **Watch for Race Conditions:**
    
    - In parallel processing scenarios, be vigilant for race conditions—situations where system behavior depends on event timing.
        
    - Implement safeguards to mitigate these issues and ensure smooth execution.
