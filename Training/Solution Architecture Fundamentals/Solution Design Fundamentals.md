## Designing Solution Architecture Diagrams

**Definition:**  
Solution architecture is the process of designing a structured solution to meet specific requirements. As a Solution Architect, you're responsible for making critical decisions about:

- **Components & Relationships:**  
    How different systems and applications interact to achieve the desired goals.
    
- **Key Recommendations:**
    
    - **Overview of Applications & Interactions:**  
        Include a high-level overview of all applications and how they communicate.
        
    - **Layer Segregation:**  
        Organize systems into layers for a clear, high-level view.
        
    - **Access Methods & Data Flow:**  
        Illustrate how data moves between components and how users or systems access these components.
        
    - **Supporting Systems:**  
        Display storage solutions, databases, and other services that support your automation.

## 🔍 Workflow Abstraction

**Purpose:**  
Workflow abstraction simplifies complex solutions by highlighting only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details. This helps developers focus on their specific tasks without getting overwhelmed by intricate system details.

**RPA Workflow Abstraction Layers:**

1. **Framework Layer:**
    
    - Handles the core transactional states (Init, Get Transaction Data, Process Transaction, End Process)
        
    - Provides exception handling, configuration, and logging.
        
2. **Business Process Layer:**
    
    - Models the main business rules (often represented by a process.xaml)
        
    - Invokes components from lower layers.
        
3. **Services Layer:**
    
    - Manages interactions with external APIs and web services.
        
    - Often implemented as a reusable library.
        
4. **Application Process Layer:**
    
    - Works with applications to implement process rules.
        
    - Focuses on navigation, data entry, and extraction.
        
5. **Application Screen Layer:**
    
    - Contains highly reusable components focused on UI interactions.
        
6. **Data Layer:**
    
    - Deals exclusively with in-memory data and interactions within Orchestrator.
        
    - Contains generic, reusable components for data handling.
        

**Benefits of Abstraction:**
