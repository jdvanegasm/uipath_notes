## üîç Code Review Best Practices

### **Key Areas to Focus On:**

- **Review Every Activity:**
    
    - Ensure that no hard-coded values are left in the code; move them to configuration files or assets when appropriate.
        
    - Confirm that naming conventions and guidelines are strictly followed for variables, arguments, and workflow files.
        
- **Maintain Clean Code:**
    
    - Remove commented-out code.
        
    - Use clear annotations and comments to explain non-obvious behaviors.
        
- **Security Audit:**
    
    - Check for vulnerabilities, such as inappropriate use of application credentials or sensitive configuration parameters.
        
    - Validate that confidential data is properly secured and not exposed outside the intended environment.
        

### **Process for Code Review:**

1. **Pre-Testing Review:**
    
    - Perform continuous code reviews during development rather than waiting for the final review.
        
2. **Documentation Check:**
    
    - Verify that the DSD is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of development.
        
3. **Risk Assessment:**
    
    - Identify risks and discuss them with the Project Manager for potential impact on the project timeline and pipeline.
        
4. **Sign-Off:**
    
    - Once all code reviews and testing phases are completed, collaborate with Business Analysts, Project Managers, and stakeholders to decide if the project is production-ready.
