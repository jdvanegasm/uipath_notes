### **Fully Unattended Automation: A Game-Changer for Data Handling**

Manually processing large volumes of data across systems is slow and error-prone. **Fully Unattended automation** eliminates human intervention, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

#### **Real-Life Example**

A global financial services company must consolidate sales figures from multiple systems (ERP, CRM, databases) each monthâ€”a tedious, error-prone task.

With **Fully Unattended automation**, a robot:  
**Runs automatically** based on triggers or schedules.  
**Operates 24/7**, managed centrally by a workflow orchestrator.  
**Maintains consistency**, only alerting users in case of exceptions.

While the robot executes tasks, your role is to set up and refine the process, ensuring seamless automation and improved business outcomes.

### **Partially Unattended Automation: The Best of Both Worlds**

Repetitive business processes can be draining. **Partially Unattended automation** combines human oversight with robotic efficiencyâ€”letting you initiate a task and letting a robot handle the rest.

#### **Real-Life Example**

Mortgage appraisals require lenders to manually order and process requests, leading to delays and errors. With **Partially Unattended automation**:  
Lenders **start** the process.  
The robot **takes over**, handling scheduling and data validation.  
Appraisal time is **reduced**, improving accuracy and lowering costs.

#### **How It Works**

A Partially Unattended robot can:  
ðŸ”¹ Execute tasks based on schedules or user instructions.  
ðŸ”¹ Perform preparatory work and initiate processes.  
ðŸ”¹ Apply complex business rules automatically.  
ðŸ”¹ Validate data and notify users only when needed.

This approach boosts efficiency while keeping you in control, ensuring a smooth and reliable workflow.

### **Human-in-the-Loop Automation: Seamless Collaboration Between Humans and Robots**

Some processes require human expertise for decision-making. **Human-in-the-Loop automation** embeds business rules into workflows, allowing robots to handle tasks while seeking human input only when necessary.

#### **Real-Life Example: Invoice Processing**

- OCR technology extracts data from scanned invoices.
- If the data quality is poor, automation **flags it for human review** before entering it into the ERP system.
- With AI-driven learning, future interventions become less frequent.

#### **How It Works**

A Human-in-the-Loop robot can:  
ðŸ”¹ **Start tasks** based on schedules or triggers.  
ðŸ”¹ **Request human input** only when required.  
ðŸ”¹ **Resume automation** once input is provided.  
ðŸ”¹ **Continuously improve** by learning from human corrections.

This model balances **efficiency with human expertise**, ensuring accuracy while reducing manual effort over time.

### **Attended Interval Automation: On-Demand Assistance for Efficient Workflows**

This automation model allows a robot to launch **on-demand**, execute tasks, and mimic human actions precisely. While your machine is occupied during the robotâ€™s execution, you can use the downtime for offline tasks.

#### **Real-Life Example: Banking Call Support**

- Debit cards may be declined for **81 different reasons**.
- Previously, employees manually searched and calculated data to provide answers.
- Now, an **attended robot** instantly retrieves and presents the reason for the decline, enhancing customer support efficiency.

#### **How It Works**

An **Attended Interval Robot** can:  
Launch via **mouse clicks or hotkeys**.  
Run processes directly from the **UiPath Assistant**.  
Perform tasks **exactly as a human would**.  
Complete the task and **return control** to the user.

This model speeds up repetitive tasks, reducing employee workload and improving response times. 

### **Attended in Tandem Automation: Human-Robot Collaboration for Maximum Efficiency**

When it's impractical for a robot to take full control of your machine, **Attended in Tandem automation** allows the robot to work alongside youâ€”providing real-time support while you focus on core tasks.

#### **Real-Life Example: Customer Service Assistance**

- Agents often navigate multiple systems to assist customers.
- This slows response times and increases errors.
