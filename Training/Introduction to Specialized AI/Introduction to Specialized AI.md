**AI and Automation: Better Together**  

**What You'll Learn**:  
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Distinguish between different categories of Artificial Intelligence and their applications.
    
2. Describe how Artificial Intelligence and automation can work together to automate tasks intelligently.
    

### **Lesson Overview**

This lesson explores the impact of AI on enterprise automation, distinguishing between **Specialized AI** and **Generative AI**. It showcases how both types of AI can enhance automation, making processes faster, more efficient, and accurate.

### **AI-powered Automation**

The lesson highlights how AI can enhance automation by making work easier and more accurate for knowledge workers in enterprises.

### **Specialized AI vs Generative AI**

- **Specialized AI**: Focuses on specific tasks or domains and delivers highly accurate results. It is highly effective but lacks the cognitive flexibility of human intelligence. Specialized AI requires further training for tasks outside its original scope.
    
    - Example: **UiPath's invoice extraction** uses machine learning models specialized in identifying and extracting data from invoices across various countries, refined for accuracy over time.
        
- **Generative AI**: Can create new content, like text, images, or music, based on patterns learned from data. It has applications in content creation, understanding, and even coding.
    
    - Example: **UiPath's use of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, a form of Generative AI, helps with tasks like text generation, answering questions, and language translation, but it does not "understand" content—it predicts the next word or sequence based on learned patterns.
        

### **Mapping the Two Types of AI**

Examples of AI use cases in automation:

1. **UiPath Communications Mining** uses a specialized LLM for natural language processing (NLP) to handle loan applications in emails, identifying their urgency.
    
2. **UiPath Document Understanding** combines Generative and Specialized AI to classify document attachments and extract relevant data.
    
3. **Automation robots** submit extracted information to the loan processing system, using Generative AI to draft emails when data is missing.
    
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** ensures governance and compliance, balancing AI and human collaboration.
    

### **Lesson Summary**

In this lesson, you learned how AI amplifies automation, making processes faster, more efficient, and reliable. Specialized AI focuses on specific domains like document and data processing, while Generative AI is geared toward creating original content. Both can work together to optimize enterprise automation.

**Why Generative AI Needs Specialized AI**  
**What You'll Learn**:  
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Explain why even the best Generative AI models need an enterprise automation platform and Specialized AI.
    
2. Identify the specialized AI technologies used by the UiPath Platform.
### **Lesson Overview**

This lesson explores why **Generative AI**, despite its impressive capabilities, requires the support of **Specialized AI** and a robust **enterprise automation platform** like the **UiPath Platform** to perform optimally in business environments.

### **How the UiPath Platform Works with Generative AI**

Generative AI is powerful and promising, capable of solving complex problems. However, for enterprise applications, **context** is essential for it to work effectively. While **prompts** can provide some context, they may not be sufficient in enterprise settings.

- The **UiPath Platform** excels by extracting relevant data and offering it to Generative AI as context, improving its performance.
    
- It also provides **action capabilities**, ensuring that Generative AI doesn't just generate content but can take action based on the data provided.
    

### **A Closer Look at UiPath Specialized AI**

**Specialized AI** refers to AI trained for specific tasks, as opposed to Generalized AI or Generative AI, which are designed to handle a broad range of topics. In the context of the UiPath Platform, **Specialized AI** focuses on:

1. **Document Understanding**: Leveraging machine learning for intelligent document processing.
    
2. **Machine Learning**: Deploying models to accelerate and improve automation processes.
    
3. **Communications Mining**: Using a proprietary large language model (LLM) with natural language processing (NLP) to handle unstructured communication data.
### **Lesson Summary**

To deliver the best results, **Generative AI** needs context, which is provided by a mature enterprise automation platform like **UiPath**. Additionally, it requires **action capabilities** to turn insights into tangible outcomes. In the UiPath Platform, **Specialized AI** is fine-tuned to specific tasks, such as document processing and communications mining, to improve automation efficiency and accuracy.

## 1. Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?

- **Definition:**  
    Machine Learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and past experiences. Its algorithms deduce patterns to predict future information without being explicitly programmed for each task.
    

### Objective of a Machine Learning Algorithm

- **Purpose:**  
    It maps input variables to output variables—a process that allows the model to make predictions on new data.
    

### How Does Machine Learning Work?

- **Concept:**  
    It is about computers learning from experience. The system makes predictions or builds models based on patterns recognized in the data.
    

### Types of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning

- **Description:**  
    Algorithms map inputs to outputs using a known correct answer.

    - **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value (e.g., amount, weight).
        

#### Unsupervised Learning

- **Description:**  
    Algorithms find the underlying structure in data without labeled outputs.
    
- **Problems:**
    
    - **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points (e.g., detecting fraud in credit card transactions).
        
    - **Association:** Identifying correlations (e.g., people who buy X also buy Y).
        

#### Reinforcement Learning

- **Description:**  
    Learning by trial and error using rewards and penalties.
    
- **Example:**  
    A robot learning to shoot a basketball improves its actions based on whether it scores.
