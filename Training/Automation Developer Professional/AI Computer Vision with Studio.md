## üß† **Basics of AI Computer Vision**

### ‚úÖ What is Computer Vision?

- It allows robots to **"see"** the UI visually instead of relying only on selectors.
    
- Uses **AI (Object Detection, OCR, Fuzzy Matching, Icon Detection)** + **Anchoring System** to locate and interact with elements reliably.
    

### ‚úÖ Why is it needed?

- Traditional OCR/Image Matching often fails in **Virtual Desktop Environments (VDIs)** like Citrix, VMware, RDP.
    
- CV offers **human-like recognition** to handle **dynamic UI changes** more robustly.
    

### ‚úÖ Real-World Applications:

- **Invoice Processing:** Reads data from varied invoice formats.
    
- **Document Classification:** Sorts and routes emails/contracts intelligently.
    
- **Automated Data Entry:** Extracts info from forms into databases.
    

### ‚úÖ How it improves automation:

- Enhances **accuracy**, **resilience**, and **adaptability** in automation.
    
- Works well with **scrollable, dynamic content**, even when elements change position or style.
    

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits:

1. Works beyond selectors (PDFs, images).
    
2. Intelligent interaction using **multi-anchoring system**.
    
3. Compatible with **VDIs and hybrid interfaces**.
    
4. Supports **tables, dropdowns, checkboxes**.
    
5. **Auto-scroll** feature for long content.

## üîç **Computer Vision vs. UI Automation**

**‚è± Duration: 10 min**

|Feature|UI Automation|Computer Vision|
|---|---|---|
|**Element Detection**|Uses **selectors**|Uses **neural network + AI**|
|**Scrolling Support**|Limited, struggles with infinite scroll|**Auto-scroll** support|
|**Table Extraction**|Works on structured tables|**Flexible**, works even when structure is unclear|
|**Targeting**|Selectors, anchor base, image automation|Uses **visual cues** and **anchors**|

### ‚úÖ When to Use:

- Use **UI Automation** when dealing with stable, modern apps (with good selectors).
    
- Use **Computer Vision** for **remote environments**, **scanned docs**, and **dynamic UIs**.
    
- Best practice: **Combine both** based on context for reliable automation.

## üßæ Final Summary:

- **AI Computer Vision** empowers robots to interact visually like humans.
    
- It excels in **unstructured**, **dynamic**, and **remote environments**.
    
- UiPath's CV activities and features provide a powerful toolset for automation where selectors fall short.

1. Open Studio and click **Computer Vision Recorder**.
    
2. Click **Record** and select the application window to automate.
    
3. The selected app is sent to the CV server and screen enters **recording mode**.
    
4. Perform UI interactions ‚Äì they are recorded as **CV Click, CV GetText**, etc.
    
5. Use:
    
    - **Refresh** if the app content changes.
        
    - **Change Application** to switch windows.
        
6. When done, click **Save & Quit** ‚Äì all actions are inserted into your workflow.
    

### üîê API Key / Licensing:

- Needed only if using UiPath Automation Cloud.
    
- To get the key:
    
    1. Go to [cloud.uipath.com](https://cloud.uipath.com/)
        
    2. Admin ‚Üí License ‚Üí Robots & Services ‚Üí Copy API Key.
        
    3. Paste into **Project Settings > Computer Vision > ApiKey**.
        

> Community users can use it **freely**, within specific limits.

### üß™ Demo Recap:

- UI Demo app was used to record data entry in two tabs: **Deposit** and **Withdrawal**.
    
- Used anchors when elements had **duplicate matches**.
    
- Recorded **CV Click**, **CV GetText**, etc.
    
- Stored transaction numbers in variables.
    
- Added **Write Line** to display them.
    

### üìå Key Takeaways:

- Fast, reliable creation of CV-based workflows.
    
- Reduces manual configuration of CV activities.
    
- Reusable in **local and virtual environments** (Citrix, RDP, etc.).

## üìä **Tabular Data Extraction with Scrolling**

**‚è± Duration: 10 min**

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Extract data from **scrollable tables** (local or remote) using **CV Extract Table**, especially useful in **Citrix/RDP environments**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Main Properties of `CV Extract Table`:

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|`DelayScreenshotAfterScroll`|Wait time (ms) before capturing screen after scroll.|
|`NumberOfScrolls`|Scrolls per capture (e.g., 1 = scroll once then capture).|

## ‚úÖ **AI Computer Vision Best Practices**

These tips help improve reliability and performance, especially in **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)** environments like Citrix, RDP, or VMware.

### üß© Best Practices:

1. **Select specific UI areas**  
    Focus on **smaller, clear regions** when working with repeated or similar labels. This avoids ambiguity in field selection.
    
2. **Ensure a stable RDC**  
    A **stable Remote Desktop Connection** avoids disconnections, timeouts, and rendering issues.
    
3. **Secure credential management**  
    Use **Windows Credential Manager** and **Get Secure Credential** activity to protect sensitive data.
    
4. **Add the API Key in Project Settings**  
    Paste your **Computer Vision API key** in **Project Settings > Computer Vision > ApiKey**.
    
5. **Global API Key behavior**  
    Editing the `ApiKey` in one **CV Screen Scope** changes it for **all scopes** in that workflow.
