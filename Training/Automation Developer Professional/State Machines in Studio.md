## üîß **Workflow Design Layouts in UiPath Studio**

UiPath offers **three main layout diagrams** for structuring automation workflows:

### 1. **Sequence**

- **Best for:** Simple, linear workflows (e.g., data entry, UI navigation).
    
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - Executes top to bottom.
        
    - Easy to assemble and understand.
        
    - Ideal for straightforward, step-by-step tasks.
        
    - Allows local error handling without affecting the entire process.
        

---

### 2. **Flowchart**

- **Best for:** Medium to complex processes with multiple decisions.
    
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - 2D visual logic with conditional branching.
        
    - More flexible and visually clear than sequences.
        
    - Allows multiple entry/exit points via arrows (use carefully to avoid messy logic).
        
    - Suitable for processes that require validation, checks, or repeated decisions.
        

---

### 3. **State Machine**

- **Best for:** Complex, event-driven or cyclic processes.
    
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - Built from **States** and **Transitions**.
        
    - States perform activities; transitions control flow based on conditions.
        
    - Designed for **finite state control** and high-level process structuring.
        
    - Typically used in `Main.xaml` in REFramework.

## üîÑ **State Machine: Concepts & Structure**

### üß© **Components**

- **State**:
    
    - Has **Entry**, **Exit**, and **Transitions**.
        
    - Entry = actions when state starts.
        
    - Exit = actions before leaving the state.
        
    - Transitions = outgoing paths based on conditions.
        
- **Transition**:
    
    - Links between states.
        
    - Conditions must be met to trigger a transition.
        
    - May include actions before switching states.
        
- **Final State**:
    
    - Represents process termination.
        
    - A State Machine can have **one initial state** and **multiple final states**.

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Real-World Example: Air Conditioner State Machine**

#### **States**:

- `Idle State`: Default/initial.
    
- `Heat State`: Heats if desired > current temp.
    
- `Cold State`: Cools if desired < current temp.
    
- `Turning OFF`: Final state when input is ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù or empty.
    

#### **Transitions**:

- Idle ‚Üí Idle: temp matches.
    
- Idle ‚Üí Heat/Cold: temp is lower/higher.
    
- Heat/Cold ‚Üí Idle: desired temp reached.
    
- Idle ‚Üí Turning OFF: user input = "Turn OFF".

### üè¢ **Use Cases for State Machines**

#### ‚úÖ Inventory Management

- States: Receive Order ‚Üí Process Order ‚Üí Generate Purchase Order ‚Üí Receive Items ‚Üí Update Inventory ‚Üí Complete Order.
    
- Transitions based on stock availability.
    

#### ‚úÖ Employee Leave Management

- States: Submit Request ‚Üí Check Balance ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Update Records ‚Üí Notify.
    
- Handles exceptions and notifies employee if balance is insufficient.
    

#### ‚úÖ Customer Onboarding

- States: Collect Info ‚Üí Perform KYC ‚Üí Create Account ‚Üí Issue Card ‚Üí Activate ‚Üí Notify.
    
- Ensures regulatory compliance and smooth flow.

## üìå Summary of Layout Choice Guidelines

|Layout|Use When‚Ä¶|Complexity|
|---|---|---|
|**Sequence**|Steps are strictly linear and simple|Low|
|**Flowchart**|Logic branches out or converges frequently|Medium|
|**State Machine**|Workflow is cyclic, event-driven, or has well-defined states|High|

## üß† **State Machine Process: Payment Workflow**

### üéØ **Objective**

Build a State Machine that:

- Gets an initial account balance.
    
- Accepts payment values from the user.
    
- Handles valid/invalid inputs.
    
- Makes or denies payments based on balance.
    
- Loops until the user decides to stop.
    

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Workflow Architecture**

### üî∑ **States**

1. **Get Initial Balance**
    
    - **Entry:** Prompt user input via `Input Dialog ‚Üí InputValue (String)`
        
    - **Validation:** `Double.TryParse(InputValue)`
        
        - If valid ‚Üí `CurrentBalance ‚Üê Double.Parse(InputValue)`
            
        - If invalid ‚Üí `Message Box` + `IsValidInput ‚Üê False`
            
    - **Transitions:**
        
        - To `Get Payment Value` if `IsValidInput = True`
            
        - To `Final State` if `IsValidInput = False`
            
2. **Get Payment Value**
    
    - **Entry:** Prompt `PaymentValue (Double)`
        
    - **Validation:** Same as above using `Double.TryParse(InputValue)`
        
    - **Transitions:**
        
        - To `Deny Payment` if `IsValidInput = True && CurrentBalance < PaymentValue`
            
        - To `Make Payment` if `IsValidInput = True && CurrentBalance >= PaymentValue`
            
        - To `Final State` if `IsValidInput = False`
            
3. **Deny Payment**
    
    - **Entry:** Message Box ‚Üí Inform insufficient funds + Show `CurrentBalance`
        
        - Prompt: "Do you want to continue?" ‚Üí store in `ContinueAnswer (String)`
            
    - **Transitions:**
        
        - To `Get Payment Value` if `ContinueAnswer = Yes`
            
        - To `Final State` if `ContinueAnswer = No`
            
4. **Make Payment**
    
    - **Entry:**
        
        - Assign: `CurrentBalance ‚Üê CurrentBalance - PaymentValue`
            
        - Message Box ‚Üí Show success + new `CurrentBalance`
            
        - Prompt: "Do you want to continue?" ‚Üí store in `ContinueAnswer`
            
    - **Transitions:**
        
        - To `Get Payment Value` if `ContinueAnswer = Yes`
            
        - To `Final State` if `ContinueAnswer = No`
            
5. **Final State**
    
    - **Entry:** Message Box ‚Üí "Process finished."

## ‚úÖ **Best Practices for State Machines**

1. **Use for Complex Flows**  
    Ideal for processes with repeated decisions, branching, and loops.
    
2. **Simplify Transitions**  
    Keep logic in transitions readable and non-redundant.
    
3. **Robust Error Handling**  
    Use `Try-Catch` inside states or create dedicated error states.
    
4. **Naming Conventions**  
    Descriptive names for States and Transitions improve readability.
    
5. **Logging and Debugging**  
    Use `Log Message` and `Write Line` to trace state entries and variable values.
    
6. **Testing**  
    Validate behavior across all input scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases).
    
7. **Documentation**  
    Annotate states and provide external documentation for maintainability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Takeaways

- **Always** include a **Final State**.
    
- **Only one initial state** is allowed.
    
- Each **state** has `Entry`, `Exit`, and `Transitions`.
    
- **Final State** only has `Entry`.
    
- **Avoid overlapping transitions** with the same conditions.
