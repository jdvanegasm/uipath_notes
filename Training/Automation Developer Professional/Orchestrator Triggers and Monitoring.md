## üîÅ **Triggers Overview**  
Triggers control when and how automations run. They are defined at the folder level, allowing fine-grained access. Three types:

1. Time Triggers
    
    - Schedule jobs at fixed times (e.g. every Wed 8:00 AM).
        
    - Useful for periodic tasks.
        
2. Queue Triggers
    
    - Start jobs based on new queue items.
        
    - Ideal for unpredictable workloads or processes with SLAs.
        
    - Configurable parameters:
        
        - Minimum items to trigger
            
        - Max concurrent jobs
            
        - Jobs per N new items
            
    - Example: 3 jobs processing items as they enter the queue to meet performance targets.
        
3. Event Triggers
    
    - Start automation based on external events (e.g. new Outlook email).
        
    - Created via Integration Service or Studio.
        
    - Requires configured connections (e.g. Outlook, Google Drive).
        
    - Set filters (e.g. process only ‚ÄúPaychecks‚Äù folder emails).
        
    - Events are added to Orchestrator from Package Requirements.
        

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Connected Triggers (Studio ‚Üî Orchestrator)**

- When a project with trigger activities is published to Orchestrator:
    
    - It creates a process in the personal workspace.
        
    - Trigger configuration (e.g. interval, queue name) is auto-imported.
        
    - Reduces manual work for admins and misconfigurations.
        

Steps to Create a Connected Trigger:

1. In Studio: Add Time Trigger or Queue Trigger activity.
    
2. In Orchestrator:
    
    - Go to Automations > Triggers.
        
    - Create trigger (values from Studio pre-filled).
        
    - Adjust or edit if needed.
        

## üìä **SLA (Service Level Agreements)**

- Define the maximum time allowed for processing a queue item (e.g. 2 days).
    
- Risk SLA: Preemptive indicator when nearing SLA breach.
    
- Helps ensure robots meet processing targets even under unexpected load.
    
- Avoids late discovery of SLA violations.
    

Enable SLA:

1. Go to Queue ‚Üí Edit.
    
2. Enable SLA and define duration.
    
3. Save/Update.
    

## üìò **Guided Practice Highlights**

- Dispatcher process populates the queue.
    
- Performer process consumes items from queue.
    
- Create a Queue Trigger:
    
    - Name it.
        
    - Select Performer process.
        
    - Job priority: Inherited.
        
    - Runtime: Production.
        
    - Job termination: Stop or Kill.
        
    - Enable alerts for incomplete jobs.
        
- Enable SLA from the Queue Edit page.
    
- Monitor job execution & SLA compliance in:
    
    - Automations > Jobs
        
    - Monitoring > SLA (Avg. Handling Time)
        

### üìù **Summary Recap**

- Triggers automate job execution (time, queue, event).
    
- SLAs ensure items are processed within agreed time.
    
- Connected triggers simplify dev-admin collaboration.
    
- SLA breaches can be costly‚Äîconfigure risk SLAs to detect issues early.

# Best Practices ‚Äì Technical Summary

**Duration**: ~10 min  
**Objective**: Apply best practices to ensure smooth, efficient, and reliable use of UiPath Orchestrator.

---

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify key best practices that improve orchestration reliability and maintainability.
    

---

## üîß Recommended Best Practices

### 1. Trigger Time Zone = Tenant Time Zone

- When using non-working days or calendar restrictions, the trigger time zone must match the tenant‚Äôs time zone.
    
- Location: `Tenant > Settings > General`
    
- A tenant without an explicit time zone inherits the host's time zone.
    
- Mismatches lead to incorrect or skipped schedule executions.
    

---

### 2. Runtime License Configuration

- Only **Unattended runtimes** are valid for job execution.
    
- Make sure the machine template has the required **runtime licenses** allocated.
    
- Missing licenses = failed job assignments.
    

---

### 3. Handle Default 30-Minute Check Wisely

- Orchestrator checks for resource availability every 30 minutes.
    
- During off-hours, jobs with unprocessed items may block resources.
    
- To prevent this:
    
    - Ensure queues are emptied before end-of-day.
        
    - Or use only **fully unattended** processes that don't require user input.
        

---

### 4. Keep Automations Clean

To improve performance, readability, and reduce errors:

- Close all target applications (browsers, desktop apps) after use.
    
- Remove:
    
    - Unreferenced variables
        
    - Temporary `Write Line` outputs
        
    - Disabled code
        
    - Unused or unnecessary containers
        

---

### 5. RDP Session Management

- Always sign out from **RDP sessions** on Robot machines before executing jobs.
    
- Left-open sessions can interfere with execution or cause conflicts.
    

---

### 6. Enable Proactive Monitoring and Alerts

- Leverage Orchestrator's built-in monitoring and alerting tools.
    
- Detect and resolve issues early‚Äîbefore they impact production.
